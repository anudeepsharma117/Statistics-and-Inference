## 🚀 **Skills Demonstrated in This Assignment**

* Strong understanding of **hypothesis testing**, errors, P-values, Z-tests, T-tests.
* Ability to explain and interpret **confidence intervals** and **margin of error**.
* Knowledge of **ANOVA**, its assumptions, and multi-group comparison.
* Hands-on experience using **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **Matplotlib** for statistical computing.
* Python programming for:

  * Z-test implementation
  * Generating simulations
  * Visualizing distributions
  * Applying the **Central Limit Theorem**

## 📘 **Assignment Questions (Without Answers)**

Paste these into your document and answer them in your PDF submission.

### **1.** What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing, and how do they impact decision-making?

### **2.** What is the P-value in hypothesis testing, and how should it be interpreted in the context of the null hypothesis?

### **3.** Explain the difference between a Z-test and a T-test, including when to use each.

### **4.** What is a confidence interval, and how does the margin of error influence its width and interpretation?

### **5.** Describe the purpose and assumptions of an ANOVA test. How does it extend hypothesis testing to more than two groups?

### **6.** Write a Python program to perform a one-sample Z-test and interpret the result for a given dataset.

### **7.** Simulate a dataset from a binomial distribution (n = 10, p = 0.5) using NumPy and plot the histogram.

### **8.** Generate multiple samples from a non-normal distribution and implement the Central Limit Theorem using Python.

### **9.** Write a Python function to calculate and visualize the confidence interval for a sample mean.

### **10.** Perform a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test using Python to compare observed and expected distributions, and explain the outcome.
